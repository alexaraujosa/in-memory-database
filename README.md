# LI3 - Flight and Reservation Management System

## Description
The Flight and Reservation Management System is a project developed for the **Laborat√≥rios de Inform√°tica III** course. The system processes and manages flight and reservation data, allowing users to retrieve information about flights, passengers, reservations, and hotels. The application is designed to operate in both **batch mode** and **interactive mode**, providing structured queries and real-time exploration.

### üéØ Purpose:
The primary goal of this project is to consolidate knowledge of **C programming** and **Software Engineering** concepts, including:
- Modularization and encapsulation
- Dynamic data structures
- Functional validation
- Performance measurement (computational efficiency, memory consumption, etc.)
- Usage of development tools (compilation, debugging, repository management, etc.)

### üöÄ Key Features:
- **Data Parsing**: Load and validate CSV files (users, flights, passengers, and reservations).
- **Query Execution**: Retrieve structured information through pre-defined queries.
- **Batch Mode**: Process command files containing multiple queries.
- **Interactive Mode**: Allow real-time exploration of data through a menu-driven interface.
- **Output Handling**: Generate structured results in text files.
- **Error Handling**: Validate data inputs and log errors in separate files.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure CPU execution time and memory consumption.

## üìö Learning Outcomes
- **C Programming**: Deepened understanding of C memory management, file handling, and performance optimization.
- **Modularization & Encapsulation**: Implemented a structured and scalable software design.
- **Git & GitHub**: Used collaborative tools for version control and code management.
- **Performance Measurement**: Applied CPU and memory profiling techniques to optimize execution.

## üöß Areas for Improvement
- **GUI Interface**: Develop a graphical interface for improved user interaction.
- **Optimized Data Structures**: Further enhance efficiency for large-scale datasets.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Introduce live tracking and statistics updates.
